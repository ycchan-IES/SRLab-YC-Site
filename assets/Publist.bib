ABSTRACT={The Fansipan and Tule mountain ranges, northern Vietnam, are regions with high elevations and are adjacent to the Red River Fault, which is an important structure that is related to the India-Eurasia collision. How mountain elevations are maintained today under a humid subtropical climate is important for improving the knowledge of the tectonic deformations in northern Vietnam and may have broader implications for the crustal dynamics of circum-Tibetan regions. We therefore utilized observations from field and digital elevation model (DEM) data and geomorphic analyses to constrain the active fault systems that have likely contributed to the uplift of mountain ranges. Our observations from DEM and field data indicate potential active normal and strike-slip faults such as the Phong Tho-Nam Pia Fault, Tule Fault, and Nghia Lo Fault. In addition to these observations, the results from geomorphic indices, which include both the stream-length gradient index (SL) and normalized steepness index (k<sub>sn</sub>), present high values for the footwalls of the inferred normal faults and low values for the hanging walls. Most of the identified knickpoints are related to the locations of mapped faults. Correlations of these data indicate that recent movements of the Fansipan and Tule mountain ranges are dominated by strike-slip and normal faulting under a NE-SW minimum extensional regime. We therefore propose that extensional tectonics associated with isostatic rebound likely plays a role in maintaining mountain elevations over long periods despite the continuous weathering and erosion present in monsoon-affected areas.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization and population growth in Hanoi city raise the demand for groundwater and the risk of land subsidence. This study is the first to conduct a long-term interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis with different SAR sensors including ALOS, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of subsidence in Hanoi between 2007 and 2018. The results show that subsidence in Central Hanoi had been diminishing during these 12 years, while the southern and western outskirts (Ha Dong and Hoai Duc district) had become hot spots with peak rates of ~50 mm/yr. We further model the subsidence time-series with 22 years of piezometric records to estimate hydrogeological properties in the area. The modeling yields a mean consolidation coefficient of 0.56 m2/yr, a value typical for aquitards composed of >90% fine-grain materials. The model also predicts another 0.5–1.3 m of subsidence in Ha Dong by the end of this century. Based on these results, we propose zoning for subsidence susceptibility as the basis for future groundwater management in Hanoi. From a regional perspective, Hanoi is relatively less affected by land subsidence compared to other South East Asian cities due to geotechnical factors including small consolidation coefficients, as well as social factors such as lower population density.}

title={Slow slip events following the afterslip of the 2002 Mw 7.1 Hualien offshore earthquake, Taiwan},

abstract={Geodetic evidence for slow slip recurrence changed by stress perturbations was rare, especially from afterslip following a nearby large earthquake. The first observed slow slip events in the southernmost Ryukyu subduction had occurred in 2005, 2009, and 2015 following the nearby 2002 March 31 Mw 7.1 Hualien offshore earthquake. To investigate whether the Mw 7.1 earthquake had influenced the occurrence times of the slow slip, we calculated the coseismic slip distribution and afterslip distribution using the surface displacements from onshore Global Navigation Satellite System observations. The stress perturbation on the slow-slip regions caused by the coseismic slip was quantified using the Coulomb failure criteria. We also examined the aftershock distribution and the evolution with time to clarify the stress perturbations from the afterslip offshore. Our results show that the primary afterslip distribution may have overlapped the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip patch at the downdip of the earthquake. The coseismic stress perturbation may have influenced the SSEs area directly by a Coulomb stress increase of probably 0.10 MPa. However, the 2005 SSE patch in the updip depths had only a little coseismic slip and afterslip with the Coulomb stress increase of approximately 0.06 MPa. We find that most of the aftershocks had occurred in the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip region that evolved into a typical aftershock sequence at least 2.5 years after the earthquake. The surface geodetic displacements reveal that the afterslip may have lasted longer than 4.5 years after the earthquake. The evidence for the afterslip proves that the 2009 and 2015 slow-slip patch was influenced by the afterslip directly for years. We suggest that the ongoing afterslip may have modulated the coseismic stress perturbation. It may explain the delay of the 2009 slow slip occurrence compared with the recurrence interval between the 2009 and 2015 slow slip events.},

abstract={A slow-moving landslide on the Huafan University campus, which is located on a dip slope in northern Taiwan, has been observed since 1990. However, reliable monitoring data are difficult to acquire after 2018 due to the lack of continuous maintenance of the field measurement equipment. In this study, the multitemporal interferometry (MTI) technique is applied with Sentinel-1 SAR images to monitor the slow-moving landslide from 2014–2019. The slow-moving areas detected by persistent scatterer (PS) pixels are consistent with the range of previous studies, which are based on in situ monitoring data and field surveys. According to the time series of the PS pixels, a long period gravity-induced deformation of the slow-moving landslide can be clearly observed. Moreover, a short period seasonal surface fluctuation of the slow-moving landslide, which has seldom been discussed before, can also be detected in this study. The seasonal surface fluctuation is in-phase with precipitation, which is inferred to be related to the geological and hydrological conditions of the study area. The MTI technique can compensate for the lack of surface displacement data, in this case, the Huafan University campus, and provide information for evaluating and monitoring slow-moving landslides for possible landslide early warning in the future.} }

abstract = {A natural hillslope developing into a landslide shows ground cracks and topographic deformation. Geomorphological and subsurface investigations using appropriate methodology are essential to understand the failure mechanisms and stability of a hillslope. Huafan University campus located on a dip slope in northern Taiwan is facing a potential landslide hazard. Slope movement was detected through the development of ground cracks and persistent deformation of campus buildings and facilities. To monitor the sliding behavior of the dip slope, a nail network consisting of 144 ground monitoring points was set in 2001, and its coordinates were measured using conventional traverse surveying twice a year until 2017. The 17-year surficial surveying results were presented as a time series of displacements with constraints of geometry and distribution of ground cracks and underground observations. The long-term surveying results reveal multiple potential sliding blocks within the Huafan University campus. A model of landslide movement with a listric sliding surface is proposed. Additionally, from the velocity field derived from the monitoring points, the horizontal strain rates of the slope are estimated. The pattern of strain rates indicates that a plausible fault passing through the campus may have affected the movement of the dip slope. The long-term surface monitoring of a potential landslide slope in this study provides a reliable and economical way to understand the mechanism of movement behavior of the slope and evaluate slope stability.}

abstract={Located in northern Vietnam, the Fansipan mountain range is the highest topography in the Indochina area. Until recently, there has been limited research regarding the tectonic deformation of the Fansipan mountain range and whether there are notable surface ruptures or active faults in the area. This study provides the first insight into the deformation patterns and potential active movements of the Fansipan mountain range, and may improve our understanding of the overall tectonic activities in northern Vietnam. Our observations from ASTER 30-m DEM show a symmetrical mountain form in the north and an asymmetrical form in the south. The analysis of river profiles indicates similar patterns on both sides in the north and different patterns in the south with short and steep rivers on the SW side and long and gentle rivers on the NE side. The results of the normalized steepness index (ksn) also show higher values on the SW side of the south part than the values from the other sides. These results suggest a spatial variation in rock uplift patterns of the Fansipan mountain range. Notably, the mountain front of the SW side of the southern Fansipan mountain range is associated with the Phong Tho-Nam Pia normal fault, suggesting that the normal faulting activity likely played an important role in tectonic uplift of this high mountain range. Our investigation of the stress field using fault kinematics indicates that the Fansipan mountain range and its surrounding areas are undergoing an inhomogeneous mixture of strike-slip and normal faulting. It is proposed that the strike-slip and normal motions alternated because of a permutation of $\sigma$1/$\sigma$2 under the same extensional stress regime of approximately NE--SW $\sigma$3. This kinematic pattern may effectively control the recent tectonic movements in northern Vietnam.},
